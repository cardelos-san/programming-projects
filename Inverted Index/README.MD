This is the project README file.

This program implements an inverted index search algorithm, similar to 
how Google functions to a certain extend.

An inverted index is a map of terms that function as keys to a list of 
documents in which the key appears as plain text. Similiar to Google's
approach of indexing websites in its searching algorithm.
