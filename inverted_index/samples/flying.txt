Flying
I have always wanted to fly. When I was just five years old, I would watch
planes on television. I also had a toy plane that I flew. It was just a glider and did
not really fly far, but I still loved it.
When I was 12, I went to the airport for the first time. We were going to
meet my brother. He was coming home from the war and I was very glad to see
him. But I was so excited to see the planes that I did not want to leave the airport.
I said, "I want to be a pilot." My family liked the idea. They even got me
books about flying. My teacher said that if I studied hard I could get into the Air
Force Academy.
So I did just that. I worked hard at school and I got good grades. I was on
the track team, too. I kept myself very busy. I wanted to get to go to the Air Force
Academy so that I could fly.
When I was 18, I went off to college. I took my first plane trip. I had a
scholarship and I was going to the Air Force Academy. Yes, I did it. I got the
grades I needed to get into that college.
Now I am 21 and this is my last day at the Academy. I have learned how to
fly and I have learned a lot more, too. I still love airplanes and I am going to be a
pilot now. My dream has finally come true.
